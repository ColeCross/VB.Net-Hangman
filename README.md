# VB.Net-Hangman
A functioning Hangman game built in Visual Basic .NET framework. Features singleplayer, competitive multiplayer, and a customizable wordlist file.

The program features a main menu that allows the user to select whether to player Hangman, 2-Player Hangman, or edit the wordlist, which is read from a file in the bin.

--Hangman--
This is the singleplayer hangman, where one player will guess words or letters to attempt to properly guess a randomly selected word.

--2-Player Hangman--
Similar to the above, but features 2 random words that allows players to compete. Each player will take turns, and be locked out when it is not their turn. The first player to either outlive the other or guess their word first wins.

--Wordlist--
Read from a .txt file, the wordlist features all the available words for the hangman games to choose from. Users may edit this file by adding or removing words as they choose.
